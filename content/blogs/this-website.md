With a return to taking independent projects, it seemed like it was time to have a website to share things that I'm thinking about and working on.

Website requirements and approach:
* Easy to update. I decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hosting a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) generated static site.
* Look good! I used the Hugo theme [Hugo Profile](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-profile/)
* Easy to deploy. I am using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to do the Hugo generation of the site files. It works beautifully.
