When I first moved to Portland, I switched careers from manufacturing to software and moved from a rural area to the big city. I was surprised by all of the bike commuters in the office and immediately followed their lead. Like boats, bicycles are an excellent moving engineering challenge. Extended trips on a bicycle lead to plenty fixing and roadside fabrication. Even through-the-tread-blowouts shouldn't be the end of a good tour!
